memory_order_release	
A store operation with this memory order performs the release operation: no memory accesses in the current thread can be reordered after this store. This ensures that all writes in the current thread are visible in other threads that acquire or the same atomic variable and writes that carry a dependency into the atomic variable become visible in other threads that consume the same atomic.

memory_order_acquire	
A load operation with this memory order performs the acquire operation on the affected memory location: no memory accesses in the current thread can be reordered before this load. This ensures that all writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible in the current thread.
